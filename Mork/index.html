          <strong>What is Snake?</strong>&emsp;Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes.
           Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales.
            Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors,
             enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws.
              To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys)
               appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung.
                Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.
              <a class="ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake" target="_blank">(wikipedia, 2019)</a>

              <br><br><br>
              With more then 3,000 species of snakes in the world there is plenty to learn about them.
               Even though they all have many unique characteristics about them, there are quite a few similarities.
              <br><br>
              I'll show you my favourite 5 species of snake:
              <ul>
                <li>King Cobra</li>
                <li>Black Mamba</li>
                <li>Rattlesnake</li>
                <li>Green Anaconda</li>
                <li>Green Tree Python</li>
              </ul>
        </p>

        <span class="piczone"><img class="pic" src="pics/kingcobra1.jpg"><img class="pic" src="pics/kingcobra2.jpg"></span>
        <p class="text">
          The longest venomous snake in the world is the King Cobra.
          This is a snake that has many people worried because of the way they look and the size of them.

        </p>
          <div class="minititle" id="blackmamba"><br><br><br><br>Black Mamba</div>
          <span class="piczone"><img class="pic" src="pics/blackmamba1.jpg"><img class="pic" src="pics/blackmamba2.png"></span>
          <p class="text">
            The Black Mamba is considered to be the longest of all snakes found around Africa.
            It is also considered to be one of the deadliest.

          </p>
            <div class="minititle" id="rattlesnake"><br><br><br><br>Rattlesnake</div>
            <span class="piczone"><img class="pic" src="pics/rattlesnake1.jpg"><img class="pic" src="pics/rattlesnake2.jpg"></span>
            <p class="text">
              The Rattlesnake is one of the most common ones you will find out there. They do have a type of venom in them but it usually isn’t very powerful.
              There are 30 species though and many subspecies so what they will offer depends on what you come across.

            </p>
              <div class="minititle" id="greenanaconda"><br><br><br><br>Green Anaconda</div>
              <span class="piczone"><img class="pic" src="pics/greenanaconda1.jpg"><img class="pic" src="pics/greenanaconda2.jpg"></span>
              <p class="text">
                The Green Anaconda is the one of all species with the widest mass.
                This is a non venomous snake that only looks like it would be extremely dangerous.

              </p>
                <div class="minititle" id="greentreepython"><br><br><br><br>Green Tree Python</div>
                <span class="piczone"><img class="pic" src="pics/greentreepython1.jpg"><img class="pic" src="pics/greentreepython2.jpg"></span>
                <p class="text">
                  The Green Tree Python lives in areas where most people will never get a chance to see one up close.
                  They are very colorful though and that is what gains them lots of attention.
