        <ul>
          <li>Mothers can give birth to up to six cubs at a time, but litters of two or three are more common.</li>
          <li>Just before giving birth, the mother will leave the pride and find a secluded, isolated, safe place.</li>
          <li>At 10 days old, lion cubs will open their eyes and very soon after that – between 10 to 15 days old – will start walking.</li>
          <li>The mother will keep the cubs in isolation, away from the pride, for the first four to eight weeks of their lives.</li>
          <li>At around three months old the cubs will start to eat meat.</li>
          <li>Male lions generally play no paternal role when it comes to providing food for the cubs.</li>
